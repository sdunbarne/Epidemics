# Epidemics
Section 8 of a tentative book on Markov chains, modeling epidemics as Markov chains with the Greenwood and Reed-Frost formulations.
1.      Markov chain **Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models**.
        have a population and a disease which infects members of the
        population for a fixed amount of time, after which we consider
        them to be removed, in the sense that each one is no longer
        susceptible and cannot become infected again.
2.      The **Greenwood Model** assumes the number of Infectives in
        generation \( t \) is a binomial random variable with parameters
        \( S_t \) and infection success constant \( p \), not depending
        on the number of Infectives.
3.      The **Reed-Frost model** includes an infective size
        dependency that the Greenwood model lacks.
